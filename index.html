									<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Education + Work<br /></a></h2>
									<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">Education<br /></a></h3>
									<p>My areas of study and work experience include a Bachelor of Science and Honours in Electrical Engineering at 
										the University of Cape Town (2006 graduation), a higher certificate in Life Coaching (2015) and numerous 
										short courses in the area of leadership, management, instrumentation and software automation, understanding 
										human motivation, learning environment design, and business/entrepreneurship management.  </p>
										<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">Work<br /></a></h3>
										<p> I worked for eight years in the corporate engineering space. With various multinational companies my primary
											role was as an Automation Engineer and leading and managing a team of Instrumentation and Software Technicians. 
											Thereafter, I went through a major career shift focused on driving systemic change in the Education of youth in 
											under-resourced and high crime communities. I'm pursuing my Masters in Philosophy in Inclusive Innovation with a 
											specific focus on inclusive education. I've been creating learning hubs in under-resourced and high-crime communities 
											for the past three years. My main geographical focus has been on the Cape Flats in Cape Town with a specific focus on 
											Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha.

										A Learning Development Hub in Mitchells Plain (2017 - present)</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="image fit"><img src="images/Grace Cafe.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Grace2Learn operates our flagship learning hub in Rocklands, Mitchells Plain.  
										The name of the learning hub is Grace Cafe. I am helping the community create a 
										independent education system that prioritises relevant topics for the local community. 
										These include relevant 21 century learning pedagogies, governance system 
								deployment and systemising multi-generational and multi-cultural engagement.  </p>

									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="image fit"><img src="images/BKLR.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The BK Leadership Residency is in the heart of Stellenbosch university town. It is 
										geared toward emerging leaders and aspiring leaders to do life together to amplify
									their current character abilities and priorities to impact the communities they are 
								already working in (for me, under-resourced communities in Mitchell's Plain.)</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\SiB work.jpg" alt="School in a Box work" /></a>
									<p>During my time employed and freelancing for the School in a Box organisation, I managed all the 
										tech educational centres across the Western Cape. This entailed ensuring they were using the tablet
										technology correctly, that best-practice learning methodologies were being employed and growing the 
										number of active centres. The School in a Box are one of the few EdTech companies, trying to address 
										the issue of inclusive hardware educational resources.</p>

										<h3><a href="#">Innovator in Residence - Philippi Village - 2017</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\SSPV.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My work at the Philippi Village was around connecting with potential collaborators in the broader
										Philippi, Crossroads, Nyanga communities. This was no easy task and while there were pockets of inspiration
										and cocreation, the project largely did not take off in my time there. My hope is that the deep engagement 
										sessions that were hosted, formed a platform and small steps forward for future collaboration. Trust was the 
										key building block I aimed to development with key leaders in the community. We walked together through a process
										and methodology called TheoryU with the aim of sensing what our greater intentions were, where there might be overlap
										for action and starting with micro actions to test if it works or not. From an experiential and trust building component
										this was a successful project. With more time, it might have resulted in deeper more systemic projects for collective impact
										in the communities we all worked in. I've learned a lot through this experience and have carried many of the lessons with 
										me into current projects.

							<center><h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Future Work Interests<br /></a></h2></center>
							<p>The area of work my trajectory is taking me on is in the area of residential community development.
								This area of work would focus on individual and collective transformation through incremental and 
								iterative steps of growth. My purpose in this is to help myself and others realise real justice in
								burdensome paradigms. This would include strategies such as a residency for leadership development,
								growing a localised learning hub which is material and people resource rich, bringing a living developing
								governance system for the community to enable deep engagement, enjoyable decision making and a high sense of 
								ownership in community project implementation. If you would like chat through any of these or the existing 
								projects I am working on, please contact me via the channels below.  </p>
								
							<center><h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Financial Partnership<br /></a></h2></center>
							<ul class="actions special"><p><li>Many of the projects I am involved in do not generate revenue immediately. Indeed some of 
								these projects have long term impact in mind. If you sense a connection to the work I am doing
